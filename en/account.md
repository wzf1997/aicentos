### 3. Create a Token

Go to **Console -> Token Management -> Add Token** and fill in the form:

![Add Token](/img/start/api-06-token-create-1.png)

- For **Token Group**, select **Official Channel**. This group includes the full Claude model lineup and automatically selects the best model based on task complexity. Specific channels and models are subject to change -- check the [Pricing page](https://www.aicentos.com/pricing) for the latest information.

After creation, click the **Copy** button in the token list to get your API Key (format: `sk-xxx`):

### 4. Top Up

Go to **Console -> Wallet Management**. Alipay, WeChat Pay, and redeem codes are supported:

![Top-Up Page](/img/start/api-08-wallet-1.png)

| Method | Steps |
|---|---|
| Alipay | Enter/select amount -> Alipay |
| WeChat Pay | Enter/select amount -> WeChat |
| Redeem Code | Enter code in the redeem section -> Click Redeem |

::: tip Rate Multiplier
A group labeled `0.5x` in the group name means a 0.5x consumption multiplier -- the lower the value, the more tokens you get. For example, `0.5x` means 1 CNY gives you 10M official tokens (vs. 5M at the official price).

## 2. Token Management

### Token Group Details

When creating a token, you need to select a group. Different groups determine the available model range and consumption rate:

| Group Type | Description | Use Case |
|---|---|---|
| **Official Channel** | Full Claude model lineup, automatic routing | Recommended for most users |
| **Low-rate Groups** | Lower consumption rate, higher cost-efficiency | High-frequency calls, cost-sensitive scenarios |

::: tip Recommendation
If you are unsure which group to select, choose **Official Channel**. The system will automatically select the most suitable model based on task complexity.
:::

### Token Security Best Practices

- **Rotate regularly**: Replace your tokens every 30-90 days to reduce the risk of exposure
- **Never store in plaintext**: Do not hardcode API Keys in source code or commit them to Git repositories -- use environment variables instead
- **Separate tokens per project**: Create independent tokens for different projects for easier management and tracking
- **Handle leaks immediately**: If you suspect a token has been leaked, delete it from the console right away and create a new one

### Modify & Delete Tokens

In **Console -> Token Management**:

- **View details**: Click the token name to view its group, model scope, and creation time
- **Copy token**: Click the copy button in the list
- **Delete token**: Click the delete button. Once deleted, the token is immediately invalidated and any tools using it will no longer be able to make calls

::: warning Caution
Deletion is irreversible. Make sure you no longer need the token before deleting it.

## 3. Account Security

### Password & Login Security

- Use a **strong password** (8+ characters, including uppercase, lowercase letters, and numbers)
- Do not reuse passwords across multiple platforms
- If you forget your password, use the password recovery process on the login page to reset it

### Third-Party Login

aicentos supports the following third-party login methods:

| Method | Description |
|---|---|
| **GitHub** | Recommended for developers, one-click authorization login |
| **LinuxDO** | Community users can log in directly |

After binding a third-party account, you can log in using that platform's authorization without entering a password.

### Anomaly Detection

If you notice any of the following issues, take action immediately:

1. **Unusual spending increase** -> Check whether any tokens have been leaked; if necessary, delete all tokens and create new ones
2. **Cannot log in** -> Try password recovery; if the issue persists, contact official support
3. **Unexpected balance deductions** -> Check the usage logs for specific call records to confirm whether the consumption is legitimate

::: tip Contact Support
If you encounter account issues, get help through the [Contact Us](https://www.aicentos.com/contact) page.

## 4. FAQ

### Can't receive the verification code?

1. Check that the email address is correct (watch for typos and domain errors)
2. Check your spam or junk mail folder
3. Wait 1-2 minutes and try again -- avoid sending repeated requests
4. If you still cannot receive the code, try a different email address or use third-party login

### Where to find created tokens?

Go to **Console -> Token Management**. Your created tokens will appear in the list. Click the copy button to get the `sk-xxx` format API Key.

### Top-up not reflected?

1. Confirm that the payment was successful (check your Alipay/WeChat transaction history)
2. Wait 1-5 minutes -- there may be a short delay
3. Refresh the console wallet page
4. If it has been more than 10 minutes, contact support and provide a payment screenshot

### How to check spending details?

Go to **Console -> Usage Logs** to view details for each API call:
- Call time and model name
- Token consumption and cost
- Request IP and detailed records
