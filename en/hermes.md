# Using aicentos with Hermes

::: info Project Introduction
Hermes Agent is a general-purpose AI agent from Nous Research. It supports CLI chat, tool calling, memory, skills, gateways, and scheduled tasks. It can connect to officially supported cloud services or any OpenAI-compatible endpoint.

## Prerequisites

- aicentos API Key ([Get from Console](https://www.aicentos.com/console/token))
- `git` available on your machine
- `python3` available on your machine

## Install Hermes

::: info Environment Requirements
- macOS / Linux / WSL2
- Windows can be installed through PowerShell, but WSL2 is still the recommended path
- The installer handles Python, Node.js, ripgrep, and ffmpeg automatically
:::

### Recommended: Install Web3Hermes

If you want a desktop-browser UI optimized for users in mainland China, install [Web3Hermes](https://web3hermes.com) first. It is a lightweight web UI based on Hermes Agent. Official README: [Web3CZ/Web3Hermes](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Web3CZ/Web3Hermes/refs/heads/main/README.md).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Web3CZ/Web3Hermes.git
cd Web3Hermes
python3 bootstrap.py
```

You can also use the startup script from the project directory:

```bash
./start.sh
```

The service starts at `http://127.0.0.1:8787` by default.

### Install Hermes Agent CLI

::: code-group

```bash [Official Installer]
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent/main/scripts/install.sh | bash
```

```powershell [Windows PowerShell]
irm https://res1.hermesagent.org.cn/install.ps1 | iex
```

:::

After installation, reload your shell config:

```bash
source ~/.zshrc
```

If you use `bash`, run:

```bash
source ~/.bashrc
```

If you use Windows PowerShell, just close and reopen the terminal.

## Configure aicentos

Hermes officially recommends using `hermes model` for interactive setup. For aicentos, choose **Custom endpoint** because aicentos provides an OpenAI-compatible API.

If you want to complete the full post-install setup in one pass, you can also run:

```bash
hermes setup
```

If you only want to review or reconfigure tool permissions, run:

```bash
hermes tools
```

### Option 1: Interactive setup with `hermes model` (Recommended)

Run:

```bash
hermes model
```

Fill in the prompts like this:

- Provider: `Custom endpoint (self-hosted / VLLM / etc.)`
- API base URL: `https://www.aicentos.com/v1`
- API key: your aicentos token
- Model name: `gpt-5.4`
- Context length: use at least `65536`

After setup, Hermes writes the model, provider, and endpoint into `~/.hermes/config.yaml`.

::: warning Important
Hermes expects a model with at least `64K` context for real multi-step agent workflows. For custom endpoints, choose a model and context window that meet or exceed that requirement.
:::

### Option 2: Edit the config file manually

Hermes uses `~/.hermes/config.yaml` as its main config file. If the directory does not exist yet, create it first:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.hermes
touch ~/.hermes/config.yaml
touch ~/.hermes/.env
```

Then put your token into `~/.hermes/.env`:

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-aicentos-token
```

Then write the following into `~/.hermes/config.yaml`:

```yaml
model:
  default: gpt-5.4
  provider: custom
  base_url: https://www.aicentos.com/v1
```

::: tip Tip
For custom endpoints, Hermes reads `provider`, `default`, and `base_url` from `config.yaml`. The API key can be written directly in `config.yaml`, or placed in `~/.hermes/.env` as `OPENAI_API_KEY` like above. Using `.env` is recommended to avoid storing the key in plain text.
:::

## Switch Models

To use another model supported by aicentos, just change `model.default` or run `hermes model` again.

For example:

```yaml
model:
  default: claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929
  provider: custom
  base_url: https://www.aicentos.com/v1
```

::: warning Note
This assumes the model is available through aicentos's OpenAI-compatible endpoint and meets Hermes' minimum context requirement. If you are not sure about the exact model ID, check the [Supported Models](/en/models) page first, then fill in the `default` field.
:::

## Start Using Hermes

Start an interactive session:

```bash
hermes
```

Or send a quick test message:

```bash
hermes chat -q "Reply in one sentence: https://www.aicentos.com/ is connected"
```

If the configuration is already working, you can also switch to another configured model inside the session with `/model`.

## Verify Configuration

Run these checks first:

```bash
hermes doctor
```

```bash
hermes config check
```

```bash
hermes chat -q "Please reply with ok only" -Q
```

If the last command returns a normal response, the aicentos integration is working.

## FAQ

### Why choose `Custom endpoint`?

Because Hermes treats any OpenAI-compatible API as `provider: custom`. aicentos fits that pattern, so you do not need a Hermes-specific adapter.

### Why don't `OPENAI_BASE_URL` or `LLM_MODEL` work?

Hermes has removed support for those legacy environment variables. Model, provider, and endpoint settings now come from `~/.hermes/config.yaml`.

### What if the API key is configured but authentication still fails?

Check in this order:

1. Make sure `base_url` is `https://www.aicentos.com/v1`
2. Make sure the token comes from the [aicentos Console](https://www.aicentos.com/console/token)
3. Make sure `model.default` is a valid model ID such as `gpt-5.4`
4. Make sure the model context is at least `65536`
5. Run `hermes config check` and `hermes doctor` for the exact error

### Can I install Hermes directly on Windows?

Yes, PowerShell installation is possible, but WSL2 is still the safer default for compatibility and a smoother Unix-style workflow.
