## 1. Platform Overview

aicentos is an AI access platform for developers and teams -- a unified gateway with website, pricing, and docs on the front end, and console, tokens, billing, invoices, and usage logs on the back end.

The platform supports mainstream AI models. Specific channels and models are subject to change -- check the [Pricing page](https://www.aicentos.com/pricing) for details. From registration to token creation, plan selection, tool integration, and usage tracking, everything is handled in one system.
