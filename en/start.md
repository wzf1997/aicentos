## 1. Environment Setup

You can also pin a model via environment variable:

## 6. IDE Integration

### IntelliJ IDEA

Navigate to: File → Settings → Plugins → Marketplace → search `claude code`, find **Claude  Code Terminal** and install:

![Install Claude  Code Terminal](/img/start/idea-01-install.png)

After installation, restart IDEA and verify the plugin has loaded:

![Verify Plugin Loaded](/img/start/idea-02-verify.png)

::: info
If the plugin does not appear in the Marketplace, your current IDEA version is too old — upgrade to the latest release.
:::

### VSCode

Press `Ctrl + Shift + X` to open the Extensions panel, search `claude code`, and install **Claude  Code for VSCode**.

![Search and Install Claude  Code Extension](/img/start/vscode-01-install.png)

After installation, the extension offers three connection methods:

![Claude  Code Extension Connection Methods](/img/start/vscode-02-login.png)

It is recommended to connect to aicentos via `settings.json`. Click the **gear icon** in the bottom-right of the extension → **Edit in settings.json**:

![Open settings.json for Editing](/img/start/vscode-03-settings.png)

Add the following to VSCode's `settings.json`:

```json
{
  "claudeCode.preferredLocation": "panel",
  "claudeCode.environmentVariables": [
    { "name": "ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN", "value": "replace with your API Key" },
    { "name": "ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL", "value": "https://www.aicentos.com/" }
  ]
}
```

![settings.json Configuration Example](/img/start/vscode-04-config.png)

After saving, **quit and reopen VSCode** — the extension will connect to aicentos normally.

## 7. FAQ

### 403 Error

Token balance is insufficient. Top up in the console and retry.

### Windows: Connection Error or 400/401

Re-run the `setx` commands in PowerShell to write system variables, then reopen the terminal:

```powershell
setx ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN "sk-xxx"
setx ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL "https://www.aicentos.com/"
```

### "Unable to connect to Anthropic services"

Full error:

```
Unable to connect to Anthropic services
Failed to connect to api.anthropic.com: ERR_BAD_REQUEST
Please check your internet connection and network settings.
```

This happens because Claude  Code has not completed onboarding and is still trying to connect to `api.anthropic.com`. **No VPN required.** Open `~/.claude.json` (the `.claude.json` in your home directory — not `.claude/settings.json`) and add `"hasCompletedOnboarding": true` at the end:

```json
{
  "installMethod": "unknown",
  "autoUpdates": true,
  "projects": { ... },
  "hasCompletedOnboarding": true
}
```

::: tip
Make sure to add a comma after the preceding field (required by JSON syntax). Restart `claude` after saving to connect normally.
